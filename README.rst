=======
Trestus is a static status page generator that uses a `Trello <https://trello.com/>`_ board as a data source.

It was inspired by the excellent `statispage <https://github.com/jayfk/statuspage>`_ project, which uses Github issues to drive a status page, and then stores on the same repo to be served via Github Pages, and `The Changelog Weekly <>`_, who use `Trello as a CMS <>`_ to generate their insanely useful newsletter.

Why?
----

Because you should be informing your customers of outages and issues affecting the services they use, and Trello is a rvery fast and easy to use interface for defining outages and investigations through kanban cards/lanes.
